# Trees

Create a Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree, then go through the tree using breadth-first-search

## Challenge

### Binary Tree
  * Create a Binary Tree class
    * create a method for each of the depth first traversals: pre order, in order, post order
    * Each depth first traversal method should return an array of values, ordered appropriately.
### Binary Search Tree
 - Create a Binary Search Tree class
    - Add
       - Arguments: value
       - Return: nothing
       - Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
    - Contains
       - Argument: value
       - Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is - in the tree at least once.

## Approach & Efficiency
- The space and time for each of these are O(n)



## API

- pre_order(): This method performs a pre-order traversal of the tree and returns a list of the values of the nodes in the tree. 
- in_order(): This method performs an in-order traversal of the tree and returns a list of the values of the nodes in the tree. 
- post_order(): This method performs a post-order traversal of the tree and returns a list of the values of the nodes in the tree.
