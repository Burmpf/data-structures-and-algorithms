# Insertion Sort

### Assignment:
- Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary trees as parameters.
- Using your Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in both trees.



### Implementation:
- Create a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary trees as parameters.
- Go through each tree and add the values to a hashmap.
- Go through the second tree and check if the values are in the hashmap.
- If the value is in the hashmap, add it to a set for duplicates.
